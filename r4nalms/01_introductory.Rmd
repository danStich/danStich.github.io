### <b> Introductory R </b>

<br>

#### Introduction

Welcome to programming in R. This module will serve as a tutorial to help you get acquainted with the R programming environment, and get you started with some basic tools and information to help along the way. 

Like any language, the learning curve for R is steep (like a cliff, not a hill), but once you get the hang of it you can learn a lot really quickly. Cheat sheets like this one (or [these](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) ones) can help you along the way by serving as handy references.

<br>

##### Working with code
We will spend a bit of time during the morning session to orient attendees with the RStudio IDE and talk about file management. Here are some additional pointers about working with code.

There are a lot of different ways to write computer code. Each has pros and cons and **all** of them are intended to increase efficiency and readability. There is no "right" way to edit your code, but it will make your life easier if you find a style you like and stick to those conventions. Here are a couple of points that can be really helpful when you are just starting out:

<br>

##### Commenting code is helpful

```{r}
# This is a comment. 
# We know because it is preceded 
# by a hashtag, or 'octothorpe'.

# R ignores comments so you have
# a way to write down what you have
# done or what you are doing.

# This is really useful for 
# sharing code or just figuring out
# what you did.
```

<br>

##### There are a few ways to run code once it is written:

1. Click on a line of code and press ctrl + Enter
     
2. Highlight a chunk of code and do the same

3. Either 1 or 2, but press the 'Run' button at the top of the source
   file to run the code block.
   
4. Once you've run a code block you can change it and then press the
   button next to 'Run' (or ctrl+shift+P)  to 're-run' the previous
   block of code.

> Try it on your own!

Type the following line of code into a blank source file, and run it.
```{r}
# Add 1 and 1 together
1 + 1
```

<br>

##### Section breaks help organization

I like to use the built-in heading separate big chunks of code and keep things organized. It works really well for code-folding in R and when I've written a script that is several hundred lines long, some times all I want to see are the section headings. Go ahead and paste the code below into a source file. Press the upside-down triangle to the right of the line number to see what it does.

```{r}

# Section heading ----
# Follow a comment with four dashes
# to insert a section heading

```

<br>

##### Some stricter R programming rules:
All code is in R is case sensitive
```{r}
# Example (run the following lines):
  a = 1
  A = 2
  a == A
```      

<br>

We have few things going on above.

1. We've defined a couple of objects for the first time. You do this by assigning the value on the right of the arrow to the variable on the left. We can use the assignment arrow `<-` or an equal sign `=`. The former is preferred, but for our purposes it will make absolutely no difference, and `=` is much faster to type than `<-`.

2. Note in the output that the two objects are not the same, and R knows this when we test to see.

3. The `==` that we typed is a logical test that checks to see if the two objects are identical. If they were, then R would have returned a `TRUE` instead of `FALSE`. This **operator** is very useful, and is common to a number of programming languages.

<br>

You can't start an object name with a number, but you can end it with one.
```{r, eval=FALSE}  
# In Rstudio there are nifty little 
# markers to show this is broken
  1a = 1 

# But this one works 
# Try it by typing 
# a1,
# print(a) or
# show(a) 
# in the console: 
  a1 = 1 
```

<br>

R will overwrite objects sequentially, so don't name two things the same, unless you don't need the first. Even then it is risky business. In the example below, our object `a` takes on the second value provided.
```{r}
  a = 1
  a = 2
  a
```

<br>

Some things can be expressed in multiple ways. For example, both 'T' and 'TRUE' can be used to indicate a logical value of TRUE.
```{r}
  T == TRUE
```

<br>

Some names are reserved or pre-defined. Did you notice that R already knew what T and TRUE were without us defining them? These reserved operators, and built in **functions** are the building blocks of the R language.

For example,
```{r, eval=FALSE}
  in, if, else, for, function()
```
...and a mess of others have special uses. If it is not obvious already, we should avoid using these words to name objects that we define in our source files.

<br>

Some **symbols** are also reserved for special use as operators, like:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
+,-, *, /, % %, &, |, <, >, (, {, [, '', "", ...
```
...and a bunch of others. A lot of these are really useful.

<br>

##### Some other handy coding tricks

The `home` button will move you to the start of the line of code, and to the start of the line if you press it twice.

The `end` button on your keyboard will take you to the end of a line so you can edit code. These will help you move around your code faster.

The `tab` button on your keyboard will move the code to the right some number of spaces (user defined). Pressing `SHIFT + TAB` will move code to the left. These can help you organize your code.

Single click moves the cursor into position. Double click will highlight the word you are clicking, and a triple left click will highlight an entire line.

Use search and replace functionality to copy big chunks of code and change names as needed. You can also use this to just search your code. Press `CTRL + F` to open the sub menu at the top. When code gets so redundant that you copy and paste the same code several times, you are probably better off writing a function that you can use whenever you like.

<br>

##### Functions are the life blood
Functions really make R what it is. These are all of the commands that are available to a user through the base software, or through **packages** that can be added on. When you can't find the function you need you can write one to do it (eventually). At its most basic level, **functions** do stuff to **objects** in R. This is what makes R both a *functional* programming language and an *object-oriented* programming language.

<br>

#### Data structures and manipulation
##### Vectors
Despite the wide range of uses you hear about, R is a statistical programming language at its core. It is not a mathematical language or a general programming language, although it has a lot of  functionality outside this original scope. R is what is known as a "high-level" or "interpreted" programming language. This means the pieces that make it up are a little more intuitive to the average user than most low-level languages like C or C++. The back-end of R is, in fact, a collection of low-level code that builds up the functionality that we need. This means that R has a broad range of uses, from data management to math, and even GIS and data visualization tools, all of which are conveniently wrapped in an "intuitive", "user-friendly" language.

Part of this flexibility comes from the fact that R is also a "vectorized" language. Why do you care about that? This will help you wrap your head around how objects are created and stored in R, which will help you understand how to make, access, modify, and combine the data that you will need for any approach to data analysis.

Let's take a look at how this works and why it matters. Here, we have defined 'a' as a variable with the value of 1...or have we?
```{r}
  a = 1
  a
```  

<br>

What is the square bracket in the output here? It's an index. The index is telling us that the first element of `a` is 1. This means that `a` is actually a "vector", not a "scalar" or singular value. You can think of a vector as a column in an excel spreadsheet or an analagous data table. By treating every variable as a vector, or an element thereof, the language becomes much more generalizable.

So, even if we define something with a single value, it is still just a vector with one element. For us, this is important because of the way that it lets us do math. It makes vector operations so easy that we don't even need to think about them when we start to make statistical models. It makes working through the math a zillion times easier than on paper! In terms of programming, it can make a lot of things easier, too.

The vector is the basic unit of information in R. Pretty much everything else is either made of vectors, or can be contained within one. Wow, what an existential paradox *that* is. Let's play with some:

<br>

###### Atomic vectors

A vector that can hold one and only one kind of data:

+ Character
+ Numeric
+ Integer
+ Logical
+ Factor
+ Date/time

And some others, but none with which we'll concern ourselves.

Below are some examples of `atomic vectors`. Run the code to see what it does:

<br>

###### Integers and numerics
```{r}    
    a = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # Make a vector of integers 1-5
    print(a) # One way to look at our vector
    show(a)  # Another way to look at it
    a        # A third way to look at it
    str(a)   # Look at the structure, integer class
```    

<br>
    
Here is another way to make the same vector, but we need to pay attention to how R sees the data type. A closer look shows that this produces a numeric vector instead of an integer vector, which can become important when writing statistical models.

<br>

```{r}
# Define the same vector using a sequence
a = seq(from=1, to=5, by=1) 
str(a)       
```

<br>
   
###### Characters and factors
**Characters** are anything that is represented as text strings.
```{r}    
b = c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') # Make a character vector
b                              # Print it to the console
str(b)                         # Now it's a character vector
b = as.factor(b)               # But we can change if we want
b                             
str(b)                         # Look at the data structure
```

<br>

**Factors** are a special kind of data type in R that we may run across from time to time. They have 'levels' that can be ordered numerically. This is not really important except that it becomes really useful for coding variables used in matrices for statistical models- R does most of this behind the scenes and we won't have to worry about it for the most part. In fact, in a lot of cases we will want to change factor vectors to numeric or character class so they are easier to manipulate.

<br>

This is what it looks like when we code a factor as number:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
as.numeric(b) 

# What did that do?
?as.numeric   
```

<br>

We can ask R what functions mean by adding a question mark as we do above. And not just functions: we can ask it about pretty much any built-in object.

<br>

###### Logical vectors
Most of the logicals we deal with will be yes/no or comparisons to determine whether a given piece of information matches a condition. Here, we use a logical check to see if the object `a` we created earlier is the same as object `b`. If we store the results of this logical check to a new vector `c`, we get a new logical vector of `TRUE` and `FALSE`.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    c <-  a == b 
    c            # The '==' compares the numeric vector to the factor one
    str(c)       
```

<br>

We now have a logical vector. For the sake of demonstration, we could perform any number of logical checks on a vector (it does not need to be a logical like `c`).
```{r}   
is.na(a)     # We can check for missing values
is.finite(a) # We can make sure that all values are finite
!is.na(a)    # The exclamation point means 'not'
a == 3       # We can see if specific elements meet a criterion
unique(b)    # We can just look at unique values
```

<br>

The examples above all are examples of simple vector operations. These form the basis for data manipulation and analysis in R.

<br>

##### Vector operations
A lot of data manipulation in R is based on logical checks like the ones shown above. We can take these one step further to actually perform one one might think of as a query.

For example, we can reference specific elements of vectors directly. Here, we specify that we want to print the third element of 'a'.
```{r}
    # This one just prints it
    a[3] 
    
    # This one stores it in a new object
    f <- a[3]
```

> Important

If it is not yet obvious, we have to assign mutations to new objects for the values to be useable in the future. In the example above, a is never actually *changed*. This is a common source of confusion early on.

Going further, we could select vector elements based on  some condition. On the first line of code, we tell R to show us the indices of the elements in vector `b` that match the character string `c`. Outloud, we would say `b` where the value of `b` is equal to '`c`' in the first example. We can also use built-in R functions to just store the indices for all elements of `b` where `b` is equal to the character string '`c`'.
```{r}
    b[b=='c'] 
    which(b=='c')
```

<br>

Perhaps more pragmatically speaking, we can do elementwise operations on vectors really easily in R.
```{r}
    a * .5   # Multiplication
    a + 100  # Addition
    a - 3    # Subtraction
    a / 2    # Division
    a ^ 2    # Exponentiation
    exp(a)   # This is the same as 'e to the...'
    log(a)   # Natural logarithm
    log10(a) # Log base 10

    b = as.character(b)
    paste(b, 'AAAA', sep='') # We can append text
    paste('AAAA', b, sep='') # We can do it the other way
    paste('AAAA', b, sep='--') # Add symbols to separate
    gsub(pattern='c', replacement='AAAA', b) # We can replace text

    e = paste('AAAA', b, sep='') # Make a new object
    e                            # Print to console
    substr(e, start=5, stop=5)   # We can strip text (or dates, or times, etc.)
```

We can check how many elements are in a vector.
```{r}
    length(a) # A has a length of 5, try it and check it
    a         # Yup, looks about right
```

<br>

And we can do lots of other nifty things like this.

<br>

##### Matrices
Matrices are rectangular objects that we can think of as being made up of vectors.

We can make matrices by binding vectors that already exist
```{r}
  cbind(a,e)
```

<br>
 
Or we can make an empty one to fill.
```{r}

  matrix(0, nrow=3, ncol=4)
```

<br>
 
Or we can make one from scratch.
```{r}
  mat = matrix(seq(1, 12), ncol=3, nrow=4)
```

<br>
 
We can do all of the things we did with vectors to matrices, but now we have more than one column, and official 'rows' that we can also use to these ends:
```{r}
  ncol(mat)   # Number of columns
  nrow(mat)   # Number of rows
  length(mat) # Total number of entries
  mat[2, 3]   # Value of row 2, column 3
  str(mat)    
```

<br>
 
See how no. of rows and columns is defined in data structure? With rows and columns, we can assign column names and row names.
```{r}
  colnames(mat) = c('first', 'second', 'third')
  rownames(mat) = c('This', 'is', 'a', 'matrix')
  mat
  str(mat) # Take a look to understand
  mat*2 
```  

<br>

All the same operations we did on vectors above...one example

<br>

More on matrices as we need them. We won't use these a lot in this module, but R relies heavily on matrices to do linear algebra behind the scenes in the models that we will be working with.

<br>

##### Dataframes
Dataframes are like matrices, only not. They have a row/column structure like matrices. But, they can hold more than one data type!

**Dataframes** are made up of **atomic vectors**.

This is probably the data structure that we will use most here, along with atomic vectors.

Let's make a dataframe to see how it works.
```{r}
# Make a new object 'a' from a sequence  
a = seq(from=.5, to=10, by = .5)  
  
# Vector math- raise each 'a' to power of 2
b = a^2                           

# Replicates values in object a # of times  
c = rep(c('a','b','c','d'), 5)    

# Note, we don't use quotes for objects,
# but we do for character variables
d = data.frame(a, b, c)           
```

<br>

Now we can look at it:
```{r}
  d # Print the dataframe
```

<br>

Notice that R assigns names to dataframes on the fly based on object names. They are not `colnames` as with matrices, they are `names`.
```{r}
  # We can look at these
    names(d)     # All of the names
    names(d)[2]  # One at a time: note indexing, names(d) is a vector!!
  # We can change the names
    names(d) = c('Increment', 'Squared', 'Class') # All at once- note quotes
    names(d)               # Print it to see what this does
    names(d)[3] = 'Letter' # Or, one at a time..
    names(d)               # Print it again to see what changed
    e = d                  # We can also rename the entire dataframe
    head(e)                # Head shows first six rows by default
    head(e, 10)            # Or, we can look at any other number that we want
    e$Sqrt = sqrt(e$Increment)
    e # We can make new columns in data frames really easily like this!
```

<br>

Looking at specific elements of a dataframe is similar to a matrix, with some added capabilities. We'll do this with some real data so it's more fun. Most of the packages in R have built in data sets that we can use for examples, too. For now, let's read in our first real data file as most of our data are stored that way and will be read in as `.csv` or `.txt` files.

<br>

##### Loading data from files
First, we need to make sure that the data are in a place where R can access them. One way to do this is to hard-code the file path (e.g., "C:/Users/...physical.csv"), but that makes it a pain when you hand off code or reorganize computer files. I usually just make sure that my data and my code are in the same directory on my computer if I am working on an analysis of some sort (or writing a website in this case). Then, we can set the working directory in R to that folder using any number of different options.

Next, we have to assign our data to a new object, or R will just dump it to the console and it won't be stored in our environment. In this case, I am going to give my data a meaningful name based on the lake from which they were collected.

Finally, we have to tell R how to read the file and what the name of the file is. 

```{r, eval=F}
otsego <- read.csv('physical.csv')
```

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
otsego <- read.csv('data/physical.csv')
```

<br>

If it looks like nothing happened, then it probably worked. Have a look at your environment tab to make sure it is there (mine is bottom left, yours may be elsewhere depending on how you set up your pane layout).

Now that we have some real data, let's break it down a little bit,

```{r}
    ls()          # We can use ls() to see what is in our environment
    head(otsego)    # Look at the first six rows of data in the object
    nrow(otsego)    # How many rows does it have?
    ncol(otsego)    # How many columns?
    names(otsego)   # What are the column names?
    str(otsego)     # Have a look at the data structure
    summary(otsego) # Summarize the variables in the dataframe
```


<br>

Now let's look at some specific things

What is the value in 12th row of the 4th column of `otsego`? Notice that we have two indices now. That is because we have both rows (first dimension) and columns (second dimension) in our data set now!!
```{r}
otsego[12, 4]
```   

<br>

Another way to say this is, "What is the 12th value of `depth` in otsego?
```{r}
otsego[12, 'depth']
```

<br>
More realistically, we might want to know the avereage temperature (`temp`) at a given `depth` in the lake. Here, we ask R for the mean temperature at 10 m across all observations (rows). Notice that now we are back to a single dimension inside our index brackets `[]` because the column `temp` is an atomic vector inside of `otsego`. The dollar sign here is telling R to look for something called `temp` inside of the `otsego` dataframe.
```{r}
mean( otsego$temp[otsego$depth==10.0] , na.rm=TRUE)
```

Wow...heavy stuff, but this is how the wheels turn. Let's take another step back and break this down even further.

In the example above, we are using a **function** called `mean` to do stuff to an object that is a subset of `otsego$temp`. The way these functions do things is critical to working in R.

For example, we could write a new function to calculate the mean if we wanted to,... right? Here, we define a function called `myMean` that takes one required **argument**. Each required argument can take on user-specified **values**. In this case, that value must be a vector that is or can be coerced into `numeric` format. Here, we also add an **elipsis** so we can pass other arguments (like `na.rm` from above) as needed.
```{r}
# Define a new function to calculate mean
myMean <- function(x){
  # If any of the observations are NA
  if(any(is.na(x))){
  # Then exclude those values of 
  # x from calculation
  x_bar = sum(x[!is.na(x)])/length(x[!is.na(x)])
  # Otherwise
  } else {
  # Calculate from all values of x
  x_bar = sum(x)/length(x)
  }
  
  return(x_bar)
}
```

<br>

Just to make sure it works right, let's go ahead and test it out.
```{r}
test <- myMean(otsego$temp[otsego$depth==10])
test
```

<br>

Yay!

<br>

Now, what if we wanted to do something more useful, like convert temperature from celcius to Farenheit? We can apply the same idea here:
```{R}
# Define a function to convert temperature
# in celcius to temperature in farenheit:
cToF <- function(cels){
  faren <- cels*(9/5) + 32
  return(faren)
}

# Test the function out.
# Here, we create a new variable in the
# otsego dataframe to hold the result
otsego$tempF <- cToF(otsego$temp)

# Look at the first few elements
head(otsego$tempF)
```

<br>

Now that we have our new column, we may wish to write this back out to a file so we can share it with our collaborators (who for some reason need temperature measured on the Farenheit scale?).

There are a couple of ways to do this.

First, we could just use the `write.csv` function. This one is pretty limited in terms of options, but that also makes it easy to use. We just need to tell R what the object is that we want to write to a csv file and what the name of the file will be. Do be careful because this will overwrite existing files with the same name without asking if that is okay.
```{r, eval=F}
write.csv(x=otsego, file='physicalF.csv')
```

<br> 

I like a little more flexibility in the file write process, so I usually use the `write.table` function. This can be used to achieve the same end depending on options, but allows other options like ommitting `rownames` from the output file. Here is an example of how that works:
```{r, eval=F}
# Write the data set to a text csv file.
# We specify the object, the filename, and
# we tell R we don't want rownames or quotes
# around character strings. Finally, we tell
# R to separate columns using a comma.

# We could do exactly the same thing, but use a ".txt"
# file extensions, and we would get a comma-separated
# text file if we needed one.
write.table(x=otsego, file='physicalF.csv', rownames=FALSE,
            quote=FALSE, sep=',')
```

<br> 

A third way to write objects from R to a file is by saving it as an Rdata file (`.rda` extension). This comes in really handy when we have very large or very complex objects. In general, `.rda` files save and load more quickly because they are stored as **compressed** code (in the form of **lists**). Here is what it looks like:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
save(otsego, file='otsego.rda')
```

<br>

When this kind of a data file is loaded back into the environment (using `load(file='otsego.rda)`)' it has the same name, but is stored as a **list**. Dun, dun, dun...

<br>

##### Lists
Lists are the ultimate container in R. They are actually a generalized vector that can hold different classes of data. Each element of a list can be any kind of object (an atomic vector, a matrix, a dataframe, or even another list!!). In fact, even a dataframe can be thought of as a list with just one element (the dataframe). Gross, right?

The real, filthy R programming relies heavily on lists. We will have to work with them at some point, but we won't take a ton of time on them here. In general, when you run a regression model or do an interpolation, you can expect that the results will come back in a list.

Let's make a list- just to see how they work
```{r}
  myList = vector(mode='list', length=4)
  myList[[1]] = a
  myList[[2]] = c
  myList[[3]] = mat
  myList[[4]] = d

# Print it
  myList                                   # Cool, huh?
  names(myList)                            # No names on the fly like a df
  names(myList) = c('a', 'c', 'mat', 'd')  # Give it names like a dataframe
  myList                                   # See how the names work now?
  myList[[1]]                              # We reference these differently [[]]
  myList[[2]][5]                           # But can still get into each object
  # Play around with the numbers to see what they do!
  myList$c[1]                              # Can also reference it this way!
```

Very commonly, model objects and output are stored as lists. In fact, most objects that require a large amount of diverse information in R pack it all together in one place using lists, that way we always know where to find it. It seems like a lot to take in now, but will be very useful in the future.

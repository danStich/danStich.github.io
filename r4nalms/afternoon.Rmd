The afternoon session of this workshop will provide an intermediate tutorial for working with data in R. It is our hope that by the end of this session, you will be comfortable conducting some basic statistical analyses and producing related graphics. During this session, you will be exposed to intermediate data manipulation, some basic GIS functionality, basic statistical analyses, and a whole lot of plotting (including lake isopleths) using the powerful base graphics in R and the utilities provided through `ggplot2`. This workshop assumes a basic understanding of elementary statistics, and some working knowledge of R and Rstudio. Those attending the morning session will be sufficiently prepared for the afternoon session.

The tutorial for the afternoon session is located <a href="intermediate.html"> here </a>.

The data and files needed for both sessions are located <a href="https://github.com/danStich/data4_r4nalms"> here </a>.

## Introduction
Once we have a basic grasp on how R works, and how and where to find help, the learning process becomes a lot less painful, and we can start to build an appreciation for how convenient it is to have a script we can come back to again and again. To show off this convenience, and the power of R as a statistics program, we will spend the afternoon session walking through some applied analyses and spend a little more time with data visualization tools.

## Data overview and management
Before we ever get into a statistical analysis, it is always good practice to have a good, long look at the data we are working with to make sure everything makes sense, and to note issues that may rear their heads down the road.

Let's start by reading in the Secchi Dip-In data. This particular data set is a subset of the whole, and contains only those data that were collected in the state of Ohio.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ohio <- read.csv('ohio.csv')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ohio <- read.csv('data/ohio.csv')
```

So, what are we working with here? Let's have a look.

Remember that it might be useful to understand how R sees your data first and foremost. The most reliable method for doing this with dataframes is to look at the **structure** of your data using `str`.

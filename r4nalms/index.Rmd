<h3 top-margin:10px;> NALMS International Symposium Workshops</h3> 
<img src="./images/graphs.png" alt="">

Welcome to the <b>R4NALMS</b> homepage for R workshops at the International NALMS Symposium. This page hosts content for two in-person workshop sessions. 

The <a href="morning.html"> morning session </a> (8:00 am - 12:00 pm) will be an introduction to <a href=https://www.r-project.org/> R </a> as a functional, vectorized, and object-oriented programming language. It will cover R syntax (e.g., how to read and write R code), types of variables and objects, functions, basic data management (e.g., loading, referencing, manipulation, transformation, and subsets), basic descriptive statistics, and working with R packages. 

The <a href="afternoon.html"> afternoon session </a> (1:00 - 5:00 pm) will build on these techniques for an Intermediate R Workshop. Topics will include more advanced data management, an overview of common statistical tools in R, and plotting utilities. Those less familiar with R should plan on attending both sessions, but those who have some experience using R could consider skipping the morning session and join after lunch for a half-day session.

Laptop computers are required for both sessions. <b> All software is freely available and should be installed prior to the workshop </b>. Please see <a href="software.html"> this page </a> for software installation instructions.

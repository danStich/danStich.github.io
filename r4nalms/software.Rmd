<h3 id = "multi"> **Download and install R** </h3>
For <a href=https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> Windows </a> or <a href=https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/> Mac </a>. You should download the most recent versions for your operating system. Accept the default options.

<b> Video instructions for getting started with R and RStudio </b><br>
It may be helpful to watch a couple of YouTube videos before the workshop, especially if you are stuck already (no shame). There are tons of them out there, including some that walk you through how to install and open R and RStudio. They range from just a couple of minutes to a couple of hours. Here's one example provided by the [How To R Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVKMsaWju8w).

<h3 id = "multi"> **Download and install Microsoft Teams** </h3>
The desktop version will work best. The workshop will work best for you if you install Teams on the same computer as R so you can share code snippets and share screens in help channels. A web cam is not required. You may also wish to watch a quick YouTube video before the workshop on how to use Teams. We will cover briefly in the days leading up to the workshop.


<h2 id="multi">**Data and code files**</h2>

All data and code files needed for both sessions are located <a href="https://github.com/danStich/data4_r4nalms"> here </a>. There are instructions for downloading the workshop content as a compressed (`ZIP`) folder and extracting content in the README that should display at the bottom of the page linked.

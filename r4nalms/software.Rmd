To make the most of our time together, you will need to install some software *before you arrive* for the workshop. All software is <b> freely available </b> and <b> easily installed </b>. Please download and install the most recent versions prior to the workshop. If you have questions or difficulties (beyond system administrative permissions), please <a href="contact.html"> contact</a> the workshop organizers.

1. <b> Download and install R </b> for <a href=https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> Windows </a> or <a href=http://cran.us.r-project.org/> Mac </a>. You should download the most recent version of R for your operating system. Most newer laptops are 64-bit.

2. <b> Once you have R installed, download and install <a href=https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download> Rstudio </a>. </b> You should download the most recent version. This program will not work without an existing installation of R.

3. <b> Download the workshop data </b> from 
<a href= https://github.com/danStich/data4_r4nalms> this github repository</a> following the instructions in the `README.md` file.

4. <b> Save the webpage. </b> You can bookmark this webpage for easier access on mobile devices and PCs. Better yet, you can save the whole thing as a complete webpage so you'll have access to all of the content even if you don't have cell service or a wireless connection (like during travel!). Or, you can star the <a href="https://github.com/danStich/danStich.github.io/tree/master/r4nalms">GitHub repository</a> and download the code and data used to generate the website. 

**If you want to try working with code or data before the workshop, you will need to know how to install packages in R.** To do this, you can type `install.packages("PACKAGE")` in the console and run, being sure to replace `PACKAGE` with the actual name of the package. If you are working with a recent version of Rstudio, you will probably get a prompt to install missing packages the first time you open `R4NALMS_intro.R` or `R4NALMS_intermediate.R`. The packages we are going to work with include: `akima`, `ggplot2`, `plyr`, `rgdal`, and `sp`.

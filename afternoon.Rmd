The afternoon session of this workshop will provide an intermediate tutorial for working with aquatic data in R. It is our hope that by the end of this session, you will be comfortable conducting some basic statistical analyses and producing related graphics.

By the end of this session, you will have been exposed to intermediate data manipulation, regression analysis (including prediction), and learned how to make publication-quality plots using the powerful base graphics of R.

This workshop assumes a basic understanding of elementary statistics, and some working knowledge of R and Rstudio. Those attending the morning session will be sufficiently prepared for the afternoon session.

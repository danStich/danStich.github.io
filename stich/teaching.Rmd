I teach graduate and undergraduate classes in the Biology Department at SUNY Oneonta. 

In addition to introductory courses in Ecology and Evolution (BIOL 181) and Ecology (BIOL 282), I teach undergraduate classes in <a href="biol217.html"> Quantitative Biology </a> and I offer <a href="biol351.html"> Ichthyology </a> on a rotating basis. At the graduate level, I teach classes in <a href="biol678.html"> Advanced Quantitative Biology </a>, <a href="biol682.html"> Advanced Ichthyology </a>, <a href="biol690.html">Lake Management</a>, and special topics in other subjects as needed. 

I also teach R workshops like <a href="https://danstich.github.io/r4nalms/index.html"> this one </a> for the North American Lake Management Society (<a href="https://www.nalms.org/"> NALMS </a>), and I have been known to haunt the halls of my alma mater to teach <a href="classes/FWLD421/fishStats.html"> introductory fisheries statistics in FWLD 421 </a>  at SUNY Cobleskill.

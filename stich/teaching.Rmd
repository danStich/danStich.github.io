I teach graduate and undergraduate classes in the Biology Department at SUNY Oneonta. 

In addition to lab sections for Ecology and Evolution (BIOL 181) and Ecology (BIOL 282), I teach undergraduate classes in <a href="biol217.html"> Quantitative Biology </a> and <a href="biol351.html"> Ichthyology </a> on a rotating basis during spring semesters. 

At the graduate level, I teach classes in <a href="biol501.html"> Experimental Design </a>, <a href="biol678.html"> Advanced Quantitative Biology </a>, <a href="biol682.html"> Advanced Ichthyology </a>, <a href="biol690.html">Lake Management</a>, and special topics in other subjects as needed. 

I also teach R workshops here and there, and I have been known to haunt the halls of my alma mater to teach <a href="classes/FWLD421/fishStats.html"> introductory fisheries statistics in FWLD 421 </a>  at SUNY Cobleskill.

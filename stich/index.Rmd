I am a fishery biologist by training, and I have been with the Biology Department and Biological Field Station at SUNY Oneonta since Fall 2015. 

I teach classes in biology, ecology, lake management, and biostatistics. Learn more about those classes <a href="teaching.html"> here </a>.

Research in my lab includes both undergraduate and graduate students, and very often finds its way into class examples, activities, and extra credit opportunities. Learn more about research <a href="research.html"> here </a>.
